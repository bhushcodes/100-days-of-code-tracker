# Website Dashboard

This folder holds a lightweight static dashboard for the 100 Days of Code Tracker. It relies on the `website/data/leaderboard.json` file generated by `scripts/update_leaderboard.py` and can be hosted on GitHub Pages or any static file server.

## Local preview
Run a simple HTTP server from the repository root to test changes:

```bash
python3 -m http.server --directory website
```

Then visit <http://localhost:8000>.

## Files
- `index.html`: layout and semantic structure
- `styles.css`: responsive styling with light/dark mode support
- `app.js`: fetches leaderboard data and renders the table and summary cards
- `data/leaderboard.json`: generated data source that the script keeps in sync

Feel free to swap this static stack for your favorite framework if you need more functionality.
